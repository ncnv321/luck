Everything feels stuck in limbo, stagnant and frozen. There used to be a lot of life.

Lately I've noticed how much more stoic I am towards my family than anyone else.
My relationship with my parents has worsened and they insist I'm the problem, but all my life i've felt like I was being herded into a specific path to their liking for so long.

They insist they feel like they don't know me, and that I don't talk much, or share much in general. 
But there's always been reasons. It's too much and far too personal to hash out here.

After so many years of tension between me and my two sisters, it seems like we've finally made up and opened a new chapter.
I feel happy talking to them, I've always hated feeling alienated from them.

I don't know how long it'll take for me to move out, or to get my first car, or figure myself out but I'll continue to be hopeful.

Life is beautiful but being stuck in this house, in this country, near people that've never bothered to know me is soul crushing.

My birthday was 5 days ago, neither of my parents acknowledged it.

All I want is my own autonomy, my own life. Instead I'm threatened with getting kicked out for choosing to do things on my own terms.

I want to stay hopeful, I want to get out of here.
