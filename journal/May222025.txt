Dreams have been frequent and vivid lately. It could be because I've been looking after myself a lot more than usual, mentally and physically.

I want to go far away, I had a brief conversation. You should get out and experience the world more. I do! I really do, but is it worth burning through however much I have to my name for the sake of it? Money comes and goes I know, but still.

I gotta send out letters soon for a few peoples birthdays. Sometimes I wonder if my efforts will be reciprocated, they never have been but I stay hopeful.

It's a shame you haven't sent me a letter yet, but I don't expect much from you. 

Wonder where I'll be 5 years from now.

You'll see me around, even when I'm not there, don't worry.
